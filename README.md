# EzMail

**EzMail** is a secure, lightweight, and privacy-focused email and chat service built with **Go**. It provides a modern alternative to traditional platforms like Gmail, offering real-time messaging and email features with a unique twist â€” support for **anonymous access** via **OAuth SSO** (Single Sign-On).

## Features

- Full-featured **email system** (send, receive, filter, organize)
- Real-time **chat messaging**
- **OAuth SSO** support for easy sign-in (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Anonymous usage without tying your identity to the platform
- High-performance backend built in **Golang**
- Mobile-friendly, responsive UI (optional frontend included)
- Persistent storage with support for multiple databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)

## Anonymous Access via OAuth

EZMail supports anonymous access by allowing users to authenticate via OAuth providers without storing personally identifiable information (PII). Upon first login, a pseudonymous identity is generated and mapped to the OAuth token, enabling a balance between privacy and ease-of-use.
